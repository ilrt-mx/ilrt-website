ILRT (Information, Freedom, Revolution, Transformation)
========================================================

We area a social movement that DOESN'T support politic parties and that searches for:

* Cultivate human values and ideals. 
* Diffuse information that is not reveled by the mexican communication monopolies.
* Encourage mexicans to doubt their democracy.

What is the difference between about 70 years ago and today? Technology and our capacity to communicate via non manipulated mediums.

Freedom
-------

The information brings us closer to the truth, and the truth will make us freeman.

Revolution
----------

Only a free and informed nation can revolutionize his present.

Transformation
--------------

Only a pacific revolution achieves true change.
