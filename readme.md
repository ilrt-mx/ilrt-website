ilrt-website
============

ILRT is a movement (refer to the ilrt.md or ilrt_en.md), and with this collaborative project we want to empower it. We are looking for more community members that would be happy to contribute to this incredible cause by making one or two wonderful pull requests :D

Documentation and coding in English
-----------------------------------

Even though ILRT is a mexican centralized movement, we chose English for the documentation and coding because we want to let any person in the world to be able to contribute to this movement and specially to this very technical part of the project. We have translation in the Todo list.

Installation
------------

** This project needs node.js to run, visit www.nodejs.org for an easy install in your system.

** You will need to setup a MySQL database for this, check the database section of this document for more information.

**1** Download the zip.

**2** Unzip in the wished path.

**3** Install the dependancies. Run this command inside the ilrt_website directory (npm comes with nodejs):

```bash
npm install
```

**4** Open the config.json file and setup de server and database information.

The Database
------------

MySQL is needed as the dbms, we wont explain how to setup one but you can find many tutorials and guides in the internet :P.

Inside the sql directory there is an sql file with all the needed tables and the web page data updated up to the specified date in last-update.txt

To Import it using phpMyAdmin just name a new database "ilrt", select it and choose "import" in the top menu, then upload the .sql file.

Start the webpage
-----------------

To start the webpage just type this commandâ€¦ obviously changing the path to the path where you placed the webpage directory xD.

```bash
node /path/to/ilrt_website
```

Todo List
---------

* Translate the documentation to Spanish.
* Create a search form to the videos.
* Create admin tools to add videos.
* Create an extern tool to have the videos downloaded from youtube and backed up locally automatically.
* Your idea goes here! :D.
